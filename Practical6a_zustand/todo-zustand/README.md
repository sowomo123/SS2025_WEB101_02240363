# Introduction 

Create a simple Todo List application using React and Zustand for state management. By the 
end, you'll understand how Zustand works and how it makes state management simpler 
compared to prop drilling or complex Context setups. 
Project Setup 

Step 1: Create a new React project 
First, let's set up our React project: 

npx create vite@latest todo-zustand  
cd todo-zustand  

# Install Zustand  
npm install zustand 
Step 2: Set up the project structure 
Create the following folder structure in your src directory: 
![rtodo](<../post/Screenshot 2025-05-24 233337.png>)
Building the Todo Store with Zustand 

Step 3: Create the Zustand store 
Now, let's create our Zustand store in src/store/todoStore.js:
We're using Zustand's create function to make a store 
The store has one state item: todos (an array) 
The store has four actions: 
● addTodo: Creates a new todo with the given text 
● toggleTodo: Marks a todo as completed or not completed 
● removeTodo: Deletes a todo 
● clearCompleted: Removes all completed todos 

# Building the Components 
Step 4: Create the TodoInput component 
Create a simple input component that allows adding new todos:
Step 5: Create the TodoItem component 
Create a component for displaying individual todo items: 
 
 Step 6: Create the TodoList component 
Create a component that displays all todos:
 
 Step 7: Update App.js 
Now, let's put everything together in the App component: 
 
 
## Adding Persistence 
Step 8: Add persistence to our store 
Let's enhance our store to persist todos in localStorage: 
Explanation and Key Concepts 
How Zustand Works 
1. Store Creation: 
○ We create a central store using create from Zustand 
○ The store contains both state and actions (functions that modify state) 

2. State Access: 
○ Components access state directly from the store using the hook: 
useTodoStore(state => state.todos) 
○ Components only subscribe to the specific pieces of state they need 

3. State Updates: 
○ Components call actions from the store to update state 
○ Actions use the set function to update state immutably 
○ When state changes, only components that subscribe to that specific piece of 
state re-render 

4. Persistence: 
○ The persist middleware automatically saves our state to localStorage 
○ When the page refreshes, the state is loaded back from localStorage
