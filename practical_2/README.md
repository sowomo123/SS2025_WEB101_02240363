### RESTful API Weather Application 
## Instructions
Implementing GET, POST, PUT & DELETE requests to a public REST API. 

# Project Setup 
1. Create project directory structure 
 Create a new folder for your project 
 Create two files in this folder: 
 1. index.html (for the user interface) 
 2. script.js (for the JavaScript code) 

2. Understanding the APIs we'll use 
○ Weather data: OpenWeatherMap API (for GET requests) 
○ Saved locations: JSONPlaceholder API (for POST, PUT, DELETE requests) 

# Step 1: Building the HTML Structure 
The HTML file provides the structure and UI for our application with: 
● A tabbed interface for different operations 
● Forms for entering data 
● Display areas for showing results 
● Basic CSS styling 

# Key HTML components: 
● Tab navigation for different API operations 
● Weather lookup form (GET request) 
● Location saving form (POST request) 
● Saved locations display (PUT and DELETE requests) 
● Response information display 
● Location editing modal 

# Step 2: Creating the JavaScript Functionality 
The JavaScript file implements: 
● Event listeners to handle user interactions 
● Functions for each API operation (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) 
● Data processing and display logic
