# Reflection

## Main Concepts Applied

This practical focused on data visualization in React using third-party libraries. Key concepts I applied include:

- **Charting Libraries** – Used Recharts and react-chartjs-2 for building different types of charts.
- **Componentization** – Developed reusable chart components for modularity.
- **Responsive Design** – Ensured charts adjust based on screen size.
- **Data Transformation** – Prepared mock data for rendering meaningful insights.

## What I Learned

This practical helped me understand the power of visual representation of data. I learned to:

- Use two major chart libraries in React effectively.
- Render line, pie, bar, and area charts.
- Optimize charts for responsiveness and readability.
- Combine multiple charts into a dashboard-style layout.

## Challenges and How I Solved Them

### 1. Chart not rendering due to data mismatch
- **Problem:** Passing incorrect data shape to charts caused blank outputs.
- **Solution:** Ensured each chart receives the right format and keys expected by the library.

### 2. Library conflicts with styling
- **Problem:** Some charts did not scale well on smaller screens.
- **Solution:** Used responsive containers and CSS flex/grid layouts.

### 3. Recharts vs Chart.js integration
- **Problem:** Mixing different libraries was confusing initially.
- **Solution:** Read documentation and created one component at a time to avoid conflicts.

## Conclusion

This practical strengthened my front-end skills by teaching me how to convert data into useful visual insights. Now, I can confidently build dashboards using charting tools for analytics.
