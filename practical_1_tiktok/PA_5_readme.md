## Practical 5: Implementing Infinite Scroll 
with TanStack Query 
Overview 
Implement infinite scrolling functionality in our TikTok application using TanStack Query 
(formerly React Query) with cursor-based pagination. This will provide a smooth, endless 
scrolling experience. 

## Conceptual Overview 
Cursor-Based Pagination vs. Offset-Based Pagination 
Before we dive into implementation, it's important to understand the difference between 
cursor-based and offset-based pagination: 

1. Offset-Based Pagination: 
○ Uses page and limit parameters (e.g., "give me page 3 with 10 items per 
page") 
○ Simple to implement but has limitations with large datasets 
○ Can lead to issues when items are added or removed during pagination 

2. Cursor-Based Pagination: 
○ Uses a unique identifier (cursor) as a reference point (e.g., "give me 10 items 
after item with ID 1234") 
○ More efficient for large datasets 
○ Provides consistent results even when data changes 
○ Better suited for infinite scroll interfaces 

For our TikTok application, cursor-based pagination is the preferred approach because: 
● It provides a smoother user experience 
● It handles new content being added correctly 
● It's more efficient when dealing with potentially 
thousands of videos

# TanStack Query for Infinite Scroll 
TanStack Query (React Query) provides built-in support for infinite scrolling with its 

useInfiniteQuery hook, which: 
● Automatically manages pagination state 
● Handles loading and error states 
● Provides functions to fetch more data 
● Maintains a cache of fetched data 

# Intersection Observer API 
To detect when a user has scrolled to the bottom of the feed, we'll use the Intersection Observer 
API, which: 
● Efficiently detects when elements enter or exit the viewport 
● Is more performant than scroll event listeners 
● Provides a clean way to trigger loading more content 

# Part 1: Backend Implementation for Cursor-Based 
Pagination 
# Step 1: Update Video Controller for Cursor-Based Pagination 
First, we need to modify our backend to support cursor-based pagination. Open 
src/controllers/videoController.js and update the getAllVideos function.

# Step 2: Update Following Videos Controller 
Similarly, update the getFollowingVideos function to use cursor-based pagination

# Part 2: Frontend Implementation with TanStack Query 
# Step 1: Install Required Dependencies 
Navigate to your Next.js project and install the required packages: 
npm install @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools 

# Step 2: Set Up Query Client Provider 
Update src/app/layout.js to include the QueryClientProvider 

# Step 3: Update Video Service for Cursor-Based Pagination 
Update your src/services/videoService.js file to support cursor-based pagination 

# Step 4: Create an Intersection Observer Hook 
Create a new file src/hooks/useIntersectionObserver.js 
Step 5: Update VideoFeed Component for Infinite Scroll 
Update your src/components/ui/VideoFeed.jsx for infinite Scroll

# Key Differences from Offset-Based Pagination 
Backend Changes 
1. Query Parameters: Changed from page and limit to cursor and limit 
2. Response Format: Now includes nextCursor and hasNextPage instead of page 
numbers 
3. Database Queries: Use Prisma's cursor and skip for more efficient pagination 
4. Extra Item Pattern: Implemented the "n+1 pattern" to determine if there are more items 
to load 
Frontend Changes 
1. React Query: Switched from useQuery to useInfiniteQuery for managing 
paginated data 
2. Intersection Observer: Added to detect when the user scrolls to the bottom 
3. Cursor Management: Handle cursor-based navigation instead of page numbers
